# pio_benchmark

Currently it only includes some sample scripts to run the benchmark using fio. Note that we used numerous scripts for our experiments which is not included here. However the basic script is there. Please go over the readme.txt inside the 'fio' directory to understand how to run.

We will soon include our microbenchmarking infastructure to this repo as well.
